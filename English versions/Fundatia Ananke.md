## Our Values
At our core, we firmly believe that values and ethics form the foundation for creating a better future for all humanity.
### We believe in the power of an Open Mind. 
At the core of our philosophy lies a relentless pursuit of innovation and progress. We refuse to be bound by conventional thinking or limited by outdated ideas. Instead, we challenge the status quo wherever we can bring it to light.
We see opportunities where others see obstacles, and we are unafraid to be the round peg in a square hole. 
We embrace the unknown and seek new and exciting ways to effect real change. Our unwavering conviction and steadfast determination empower us to push beyond boundaries and transform the world. 
### We believe in the sharing of Open Source. 
At the forefront of our values is the belief in the power of open-source technology. We envision a future where knowledge, skills, and resources are openly shared to create a fair and sustainable world that benefits everyone. 
The collaborative nature of open source allows the community to contribute their unique perspectives and insights, leading to a more diverse and inclusive problem-solving approach that truly harnesses collective intelligence’s power. Furthermore, with open source, no hidden agendas or proprietary ownership exist, giving everyone equal access to the information needed to make informed decisions. 
### We believe in Transparency.
At our core, we believe in the power of transparency to build trust and foster collaboration. We recognize that access to information about decision-making processes and resource allocation is essential for our community to engage with us fully. By prioritizing transparency, we empower our community to hold us accountable and actively participate in shaping our shared future. 
### We believe in Open Access to Knowledge, Science, and Technologies. 
Open knowledge and science must be accessible to all, regardless of socio-economic status or location. By sharing knowledge openly, we create a fair environment for innovation where everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute their expertise. Open access to knowledge bridges the education gap and leads to a more informed and engaged society. Open science combats fake science and disinformation through peer-reviewed research and data sharing, ensuring only accurate and reliable information is disseminated.
### We believe in Decentralization.
We believe in the transformative power of open and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). DAOs offer unparalleled safety and security, ensuring all members have an equal say in decision-making and protection from coercion. They are ideal for promoting sustainability and combating inaction with transparent and democratic decision-making and sustainable technology. DAOs are a powerful solution to the challenges we face, and we are committed to promoting them.
## The Role of Fundatia Ananke in the Blue Marble Project
### Fundatia Ananke as the legal wrapper of the DAO
The Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a crucial entity in the Blue Marble project in which Fundatia Ananke is vital. 
As the legal wrapper of the DAO, it ensures that all applicable regulations are complied with and provides legal protection to participants. 
Furthermore, it acts as the intermediary between the DAO and various authorities and represents the organization in front of interested parties. 
This particular role shall be reevaluated when the legal status of DAOs has been established in the European and United States laws.
### Fundatia Ananke as the guardian of the mission and values of the DAO
The foundation ensures that the values of the DAO and the foundation are aligned, upheld, and respected. 
It also provides a platform for all sustainability projects that the DAO wishes to promote and execute. 
Additionally, it guarantees that funds are managed in compliance with legal requirements and used solely to fulfill the mission.
### Fundatia Ananke as the developer of the toolbox of the DAO
As the project management entity of the Blue Marble project, Fundatia Ananke has a critical role. 
It organizes the engineering teams, listens to the community needs, develops the applications and tools the members use in line with the product strategy document, and deploys the application and tools to the users. It is also the support interface for the users.

Its dedication to the success of the DAO is unwavering, and its contributions play a crucial role in the growth and sustainability of the project.
## The advantages of a foundation as the project vehicle
When it comes to the Blue Marble Project, using a foundation as the vehicle is the best way to achieve our long-term vision. This approach has so many advantages that we can’t ignore. 
### No shareholder tyranny 
For starters, there are no shareholders involved, which means there's no pressure for short-term valuation or hyper-growth at the expense of our users and members. 
We don't have to use vanity indicators or chase the next series of fundraising, either. 
Instead, this allows us to focus on a long-term profitable and sustainable growth strategy that benefits everyone involved. 
There's no risk of an aggressive IPO or shareholders taking control of the company and changing the mission.
### Alignment with donors 
Another great advantage of using a foundation is that we can raise funds from donors aligned with our values and vision. 
These individuals trust us to develop a positive momentum and help us bring resilience to the project. 
As a result, we’re free to put our values first and prioritize our users above all else. 
This gives us the freedom, but also the obligation, to live by our values and mission.
### Boosting user protection and innovation
We firmly believe that our users and their data are not the product but rather the blood of our community. 
We're always committed to protecting their privacy and are free to think outside the box and challenge the status quo. 
We can even pay our users for their contributions, even if it means a cost. 
We're free to set a benchmark for open data and open source and challenge the old and corrupted patent system.
### Driving ethical development
Perhaps most importantly, using a foundation allows us to ensure ethical development. We can progressively make the community the system’s owner and decentralize all decision-making about the tools and platform and how to manage the data entrusted to us by our members. 
We're free to impose transparency in all aspects of the project, providing accountability that is missing in usual Web 2.0 applications.
## Take action; join the Blue Marble Project.
In conclusion, the foundation is the perfect vehicle to empower the Blue Marble Project to reach its long-term goals.
We're passionate about this approach because it allows us to prioritize our users, members, and their values above all else. 
We're free to develop a sustainable growth strategy that benefits everyone involved while challenging the status quo and setting a new standard for ethical development. 
Join us on this exciting journey and help us create a better future!
